2-My GitHub account is where I keep my coding projects online. It helps me manage my files, track changes I make, and share my work with others.
3-The repository I created is like a folder for my project. It stores all the files related to the project in one place, so I can easily keep track of updates and work with others if needed.
4-I went to the repository on GitHub and clicked the Code button to copy the URL.
Then, I opened GitHub Desktop and clicked File > Clone Repository.
I pasted the URL and chose a folder on my computer to save it.
I clicked Clone, and the repository was downloaded to my computer, allowing me to work on it locally.
